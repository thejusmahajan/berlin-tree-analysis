# Berlin Tree Analysis: Recent Plantings (Steglitz-Zehlendorf)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of **newly planted trees** (approx. 2020-2025) in the Steglitz-Zehlendorf district of Berlin.
It explores trends in modern species selection and the spatial distribution of recent greening initiatives.

> **Important**: This dataset is a record of *recent plantings*, not a full inventory of the district's trees.
Tools : Mainly python3, seaborn and pandas

Developed an interactive learnig Jupyter notebook. This serves as a test bed for new learners in visualising publicly available data
