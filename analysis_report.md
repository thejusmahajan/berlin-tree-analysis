# Analysis Report: Recent Tree Plantings in Steglitz-Zehlendorf (2020-2025)

## 1. Introduction
This report analyzes a dataset of **recently planted trees** in the Berlin district of Steglitz-Zehlendorf.
**Note:** This data represents a specific cohort of new plantings and does **not** reflect the full historical tree inventory of the district.

## 2. Key Findings

### 2.1 Age Structure: A Cohort of Saplings
-   **Average Age**: 3.6 years
-   **Oldest Tree**: 5 years
-   **Interpretation**: The dataset consists exclusively of young trees planted in the last 5 years. This reflects active urban greening efforts but should not be mistaken for the age of the district's established forest.

### 2. Species Selection
The most common species planted in recent years are:
1.  **Tilia cordata 'Greenspire'** (Small-leaved Lime) - 92 trees
2.  **Prunus avium 'Plena'** (Double-flowered Wild Cherry) - 52 trees
3.  **Tilia tomentosa 'Brabant'** (Silver Lime) - 52 trees

There is a clear preference for **Limes (Tilia)** and **Cherries (Prunus)**, which are hardy urban trees.

### 3. Spatial Distribution
**Zehlendorf** is the "greenest" district in this dataset with **368** new trees, followed by other districts.

## Recommendations
- **Diversification**: While Tilia is popular, increasing diversity could protect against specific pests.
- **Monitoring**: These young trees require watering and care. The dataset could be augmented with "health status" columns for future monitoring.
